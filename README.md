## Challenges

## Bugs

-

## Future Implementations

- Implement fingerprintjs to remember users
  - Allow said users to edit posts
  - Allow them to delete posts
- Allow searching of posts by day, month, and year

### Noah's Tasks

- Make it so fingerprint only gets added to the database if the user makes a post (Easier to deal with on client side)
- Create blog method "findByDate"
  - Pass in date params from query string
  - If day or month undefined then ignore
  - Return all blogs satisfying query params
  - Use `window.location.pathname` to get query string from URL ?
